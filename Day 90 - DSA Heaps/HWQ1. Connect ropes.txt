Problem Description
You are given an array A of integers that represent the lengths of ropes.

You need to connect these ropes into one rope. The cost of joining two ropes equals the sum of their lengths.

Find and return the minimum cost to connect these ropes into one rope.



Problem Constraints
1 <= length of the array <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 1000



Input Format
The only argument given is the integer array A.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the minimum cost to connect these ropes into one rope.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Input 2:

 A = [5, 17, 100, 11]


Example Output
Output 1:

 33
Output 2:

 182


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Given array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
 Connect the ropes in the following manner:
 1 + 2 = 3
 3 + 3 = 6
 4 + 5 = 9
 6 + 9 = 15

 So, total cost  to connect the ropes into one is 3 + 6 + 9 + 15 = 33.
Explanation 2:

 Given array A = [5, 17, 100, 11].
 Connect the ropes in the following manner:
 5 + 11 = 16
 16 + 17 = 33
 33 + 100 = 133

 So, total cost  to connect the ropes into one is 16 + 33 + 133 = 182.

        // Add all rope lengths to the min heap

        }
        // Initialize the cost as 0
        int cost = 0;
        // Combine ropes until the min heap becomes empty
        while (minHeap.size() > 1) {
            // Remove the two smallest ropes from the min heap
            int rope1 = minHeap.poll();
            int rope2 = minHeap.poll();
            // Calculate the cost of combining the ropes
            int combinedCost = rope1 + rope2;
            // Add the combined cost to the total cost
            cost += combinedCost;
            // Add the combined rope back to the min heap
            minHeap.add(combinedCost);
        }
        // Return the total cost
        return cost;
    }
